To say this is hot off the presses and poorly tested is to flatter it but here's my first attempt.

I basically reverse engineered [Fletcher Penny's markdown plugin](https://github.com/fletcher/Markdown.ooxsl) to work out that it was a an xsl template - about which I know little.

Download the zip:

https://github.com/psidnell/oo2taskpaper/archive/master.zip

and double click on the TaskPaper.ooxsl bundle and OO4 should install it.

Then you should see a "TaskPaper (text)" option when you export.

So far it can export a basic outline successfully but looking at the input document I have a suspicion that adding formatting could cause issues.

But it's a start...
